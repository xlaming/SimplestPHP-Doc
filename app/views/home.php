            <h2>About SimplestPHP</h2>
            SimplestPHP Framework is not only a MVC script, actually is common we see a lot of frameworks on the Internet with a lot of useless features,
            well, atleast for some people, those people do not need or want a lot of things, they want just the necessary. With this such of mind, 
            we started theproject SimplestPHP, it is simple? Yes, of course, it will be updated anyway and more features will come in.
